# Linux User Creation Bash Script

### Task
Your company has employed many new developers. As a SysOps engineer, write a bash script called **`create_users.sh`** that reads a text file containing the employeeâ€™s usernames and group names, where each line is formatted as `user;groups`.

The script should create users and groups as specified, set up home directories with appropriate permissions and ownership, generate random passwords for the users, and log all actions to `/var/log/user_management.log`. Additionally, store the generated passwords securely in `/var/secure/user_passwords.txt`.

Ensure error handling for scenarios like existing users and provide clear documentation and comments within the script.

### Requirements:
- Each User must have a personal group with the same group name as the username, this group name will not be written in the text file.
- A user can have multiple groups, each group delimited by comma `","`
- Usernames and user groups are separated by semicolon `";"`- Ignore whitespace
e.g.
```txt
light; sudo,dev,www-data
idimma; sudo
mayowa; dev,www-data
```
For the first line, light is username and groups are sudo, dev, www-data

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Successful Run: The script will be tested by supplying the name of the text file containing usernames and groups as the first argument to the script (i.e `bash create_user.sh <name-of-text-file>` ) in an Ubuntu machine.
- All users should be created and assigned to their groups appropriately
- The file `/var/log/user_management.log` should be created and contain a log of all actions performed by the script.
- The file `/var/secure/user_passwords.csv` should be created and contain a list of all users and their passwords delimited by comma, and only the file owner should be able to read it.
